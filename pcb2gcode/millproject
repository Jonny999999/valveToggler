# === USAGE ===
# simply run pcb2gcode in terminal while being in this folder.
# pcb2gcode will use "millproject" in current folder for parameters by default
#
# === Notes ===
# web based gcode viewer:
# https://ncviewer.com/


# notes about kicad export:
# - dont tick "use gerber X2 format (recommended)" to prevent many unsupported warnings
# - dont tick unnecessary plot xx options e.g. "plot footprint text" it might cause hangup
# - if oval holes are present select "Use alternative drill mode" option in generate drill files menu


# === CONFIG ===
# Configuration file generated by pcb2gcodeGUI version 0.1 on Wed Apr 6 15:40:16 2022
# stopped using gui and customized parameters manually since then...


#note: in/out filepaths are added by the run-pcb2gcode.sh script now, thus commented out here:
  #back=../export/V2.1_board-ecar_isolated-B_Cu.gbr
  #front=../export/V2.1_board-ecar_isolated-F_Cu.gbr
  #outline=../export/V2.1_board-ecar_isolated-Edge_Cuts.gbr
  ##note: running for each drill file separately and merging the gcode manually (4 mounting holes are in a separate gerber file)
  #drill=../export/V2.1_board-ecar_isolated-PTH.drl
